# Introduction

This repository relates to a publication presenting a workflow to link musculoskeletal simulations to finite element analysis using consistent bone geometries and loadings.

The paper presents and uses an improved version of the musculoskeletal model published by Modenese et al. (2011).

# Alterations to geometry of the model from Modenese et al. J. Biomech (2011)
* _Hors_sacrum_ was modified to improve consistency with the muscle attachments
* _SB_femur_Left.vtp_ is provided as femoral geometry consistent with the finite element model used in the study.
