# Introduction

This repository relates to a publication presenting a workflow to link musculoskeletal simulations to finite element analysis using consistent bone geometries and loadings.

The paper, [available at this link](https://doi.org/10.1080/23335432.2015.1017609), presents and uses a musculoskeletal model of the lower limb based on that published by Modenese et al. (2011) but with multiple improvements around the hip joint.

# Alterations to geometry of the model from Modenese et al. J. Biomech (2011)
* _Hors_sacrum_ was modified to improve consistency with the muscle attachments
* _SB_femur_Left.vtp_ is provided as femoral geometry consistent with the finite element model used in the study.
