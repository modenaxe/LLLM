If you use this model for your research please cite the original publication describing the model implementation:

```bibtex
@article{modenese2011open,
  title={An open source lower limb model: Hip joint validation},
  author={Modenese, L and Phillips, ATM and Bull, AMJ},
  journal={Journal of biomechanics},
  volume={44},
  number={12},
  pages={2185--2193},
  year={2011},
  publisher={Elsevier}
}
```

The model has also been used in further validation studies for gait at different speeds in the following publication:

```bibtex
@article{modenese2012prediction,
  title={Prediction of hip contact forces and muscle activations during walking at different speeds},
  author={Modenese, Luca and Phillips, Andrew TM},
  journal={Multibody System Dynamics},
  volume={28},
  pages={157--168},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Springer}
}
```

and in a more advanced falsification approach:
