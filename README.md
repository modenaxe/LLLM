# London Lower Limb Model repository

## Introduction
The London Lower Limb Model model is based on the anatomical dataset published in [Klein Horsman et al. Clin Biomech 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2006.10.003). All the data were originally collected on a single cadaver in order to ensure consistancy between geometrical data, joint kinematics and muscle architectural parameters. Compared to other models available in the literature, the number of actuators representing every muscle was chosen through the mechanical criterion proposed by [Van der Helm and Veenbaas, J Biomech 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0021-9290(91)90007-a). The model includes 163 muscle actuators, representative of 38 muscles.

## Repository content
This repository includes materials related to the development of this model for [OpenSim](https://simtk.org/projects/opensim), the open-source software for biomechanical analysis and simulation. In particular, it includes the original models and materials used in the initial publications, and updated versions of the model usable in current versions of OpenSim.
